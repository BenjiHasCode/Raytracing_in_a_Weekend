# Raytracing_in_a_Weekend
A simple path tracer created in Java. The code is based upon the book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

The program will open a frame to show the image while it is being rendered, and will save the render as a .png when it is done.

## Example
